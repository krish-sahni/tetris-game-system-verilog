# Tetris Game in System Verilog and Vivado

## Project Overview

This project involves the development of a fully functional Tetris game implemented in System Verilog and Vivado. Designed as the final project for ECE 385, this digital system features piece rotation, scoring, and various game screens. The project showcases my proficiency in hardware design, specifically in creating responsive and reliable digital systems.

## Features

- **Game Logic in Hardware:** Implemented using System Verilog for efficient and smooth gameplay.
- **Piece Rotation and Movement:** Ensures classic Tetris gameplay mechanics.
- **Scoring System:** Real-time score counter displayed on the FPGA board.
- **Game Screens:** Includes start screen, end screen, and in-game interface.
- **Instant Drop and Line Clearing:** Enhances gameplay dynamics and user experience.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need the following tools installed:

- Xilinx Vivado
- FPGA Board (e.g., Xilinx Basys 3 or RealDigital Urbana Board)

### Steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/krish-sahni/tetris-game-system-verilog.git
2. Open the project in Xilinx Vivado.  
3. Synthesize the design and generate the bitstream.  
4. Program the FPGA board with the generated bitstream file.  
5. Connect the FPGA board to a display and control interface to start playing.  

## Usage

Power on the FPGA board.  
The start screen will be displayed.  
Use the control interface to begin the game.  
Rotate and move the pieces using the designated controls.  
Monitor your score on the real-time counter.  
The game ends when the pieces reach the top of the screen, displaying the end screen.  

## Impact and Results

This project demonstrated my ability to design and implement complex digital systems, showcasing my technical skills and problem-solving capabilities. It solidified my understanding of hardware design principles and provided practical experience with System Verilog and Vivado. The successful implementation of features like real-time scoring, piece rotation, and game screen transitions highlighted my proficiency in creating responsive and reliable digital systems. The project received positive feedback from peers and instructors, exemplifying my capability to deliver high-quality work under academic deadlines.  

## Future Work

Building on the success of this project, future work could involve enhancing the game's complexity and features to further push the boundaries of hardware design. Potential improvements include implementing a multiplayer mode to allow competitive gameplay between two players on the same hardware platform, enhancing the graphical display to include more detailed visuals and smoother animations utilizing more advanced FPGA capabilities, and developing an AI opponent to challenge the player, incorporating machine learning techniques to create a dynamic and challenging gameplay experience. Additionally, optimizing the game algorithms for better performance and lower power consumption is crucial for real-world hardware applications.  

These future enhancements align with my aspirations in automation, robotics, control systems, and hardware design, providing further opportunities to develop and demonstrate my expertise in these fields.
